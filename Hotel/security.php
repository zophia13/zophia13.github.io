                  <h1>WE CARE ABOUT YOUR SAFETY</h1> 
                  <p>Cozy Hotel has a cyber security policy that protects important physical and information assets. In general, a security policy is a document that outlines an organization's security measures and activities. A cyber security strategy does not explain a technological solution; rather, it specifies a set of aims and conditions that will aid in asset protection as well as the organization of a company. In further depth, a cyber security policy is a primary way by which administrative security possibilities are translated into defined, quantifiable goals, as well as leading users to design, install, and maintain systems.
